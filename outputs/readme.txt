Numerical results are recorded in .vtu format, and can be read using ParaView software.

The file names can be interpreted in terms of the test-parameters, as:
sample name: test1_rain=1,00_dzl=100_dl=400_rl=0,25e-6_ron=0,25e-6_roff=0,25e-6-00002.vtu
rain --> Rate of infiltration of annual rainfall [in cm]
dzl --> Depth of the lens below the shelf surface [in m]
dl --> Width of the lens [in m]
rl, ron, roff --> erosion rate constants for lens(l), onshore(on), and offshore(off) sediments
000xx--> Time; xx times 2500 annum
